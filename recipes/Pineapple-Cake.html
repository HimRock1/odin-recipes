        <h3><em>Directions</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Move an oven rack into the middle of the oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Spray 24 muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Line a work surface with waxed paper.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Spoon 1 teaspoon melted butter into the bottom of each sprayed muffin cup.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5 - </strong>Spoon 1 tablespoon brown sugar in each muffin cup.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6 - </strong>Press a maraschino cherry into the center of the brown sugar in each muffin cup.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 7 - </strong>Spoon a heaping tablespoon of crushed pineapple over the cherry and compact it with the back of a spoon into an even layer.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 8 - </strong>Mix pineapple cake mix, eggs, pineapple juice, and vegetable oil in a large bowl with electric mixer on low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Turn mixer speed to medium and mix for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 9 - </strong>Pour pineapple cake batter into the muffin cups, filling them to the top; do not overfill.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 10 - </strong>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 11 - </strong>Allow cupcakes to cool at least 5 minutes before inverting muffin cups onto the waxed paper to release. Serve with pineapple and cherry sides up. Sprinkle cupcakes lightly with confectioners' sugar.</li>
